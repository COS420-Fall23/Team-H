## Mission Statement
Our goal is to find a solution to supporting learning in augmented and virtual reality. Students often find the current style of class teaching boring and do not retain the information given for very long. Part of this is due to the information being given in a clinical information dump, rather than a more interactive and engaging method of teaching. We aim to correct this by creating an interactive, spatial VR environment which teaches various concepts and facts using a holistic, hands-on approach.

This space will be a virtual Science Center, with modular, rotating, updating displays that teach concepts from math, physics, logic, programming, and more. Multiple people will be able to access this space at the same time, and can watch each other interact with the displays, or even use some displays together. This interactive education will help students learn in a hands-on manner that promotes active engagement and long-term retention of information.

### Target Demographic
We believe that students between the ages of 12-19 struggle the most with finding the "fun" in learning. Our goal is to find a way for students to engage and challenge themselves with age-appropriate topics in a fun way using the three-dimensional VR space.

"Age-appropriate topics" for our purposes is defined as key concepts that would be or are already introduced in the classroom for a student at that age level. A College student wouldn't be introduced to foundational physics or Algebra I concepts, much like a high school student (age 13-14) wouldn't be introduced to discrete structure concepts.

## Communication Policy
- We will be using Discord as our primary platform for communication. Problems, questions, concerns, and likewise will be posted in the #team-h channel in the COS-420 and NMD-442 combined server.
- It is expected of all developers that they should reply to a question or ping within discord *as soon as possible*. Notifications for the channel should be turned on and accessible from both a computer and a mobile device of some kind.
- The use of the __@everyone__ ping should be limited as that also alerts administators in the COS-420/NMD-442 server. The use of the __@Team-H__ ping or individual pings (e.g. @Ryan G.) is preferred.
- When someone has a question, it should be directed to the team member who is most likely able to help first (e.g. if there is a problem with the repository, the project manager should be alerted). If that person does not respond within 30 minutes to an hour, another team member who is able to help should jump in and assist.

## Meetings & Synchronized Work Schedule
- All meetings are scheduled on the Google Calendar:
    - Sprint Head Meeting, Sundays @ 2-3pm
    - Syncrhonous Work Blocks, Monday/Wednesday @ 12:30-1pm (Flexible as needed by team members)
    - Sprint Stand Ups, Tuesday/Thursday @ 12pm. __*Team members are expected to respond to the Discord thread within 2-3 hours so the conversation can be started*__
    - Sprint Tie-Up & Retorspective, Friday @ 2-3pm
